# Demographic Data Analyzer

Welcome to the Demographic Data Analyzer project! This project is part of the Data Analysis with Python certification from FreeCodeCamp.

## Introduction

Demographic Data Analyzer is a Python project designed to explore and analyze demographic data. It provides insights into various demographic aspects such as age, gender, education, and income. By using Python programming along with the Pandas library, this project aims to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset.

## Project Instructions

The primary goal of this project is to analyze demographic data using Python. The provided dataset contains information about individuals, including features like age, gender, education, work hours, and income. The project instructions guide you through various tasks to extract meaningful insights from the data.

**Here's an overview of the tasks covered in this project**:

    Calculate the number of people of each race.
    Calculate the average age of men.
    Calculate the percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree.
    Compare the percentage of high-income individuals between those with and without advanced education.
    Find the minimum number of hours worked per week.
    Calculate the percentage of individuals working the minimum hours per week with high income.
    Determine the country with the highest percentage of high-income individuals.
    Identify the most popular occupation for high-income individuals in India.
